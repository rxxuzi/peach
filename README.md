# Peach 

A modern, statically-typed programming language that compiles to C, combining the power and performance of C with a cleaner, more expressive syntax.

## Features

- **Modern Syntax**: Clean, readable syntax inspired by Scala, Go, and Rust
- **Static Typing with Type Inference**: Strong type safety with minimal annotations
- **Immutability by Default**: `val` for immutable, `var` for mutable variables
- **Memory Safety Features**: Explicit pointer operations with clear syntax
- **Zero-Cost Abstractions**: Compiles to efficient C code
- **C Interoperability**: Seamless integration with existing C libraries
- **Built-in Features**: Arrays, for-each loops, range iterators

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- C++17 compatible compiler (g++ or clang++)
- GNU Make
- GCC (for compiling generated C code)
